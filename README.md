This repository contains resources and scripts that demonstrate how Python can be effectively utilized for climate data analysis.

The content was compiled during my undergraduate studies and reflects my exploration of various techniques for processing, analyzing, and visualizing climate-related datasets.

My learning journey was greatly enriched under the guidance of Dr. Jeffrey Nii Aryee, whose mentorship provided valuable insights and direction.
